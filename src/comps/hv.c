/**
* ## Brief
* `hv` runs on the F4 logic board and is its end of the UART link to the F3 power (HV) board. Every rt period it sends the current/voltage command, the commutation angle and velocity, the short brake flags and one word of current loop configuration to the F3, and unpacks the F3 reply (dq feedback, fault code and one word of state such as DC link voltage and temperatures). It also carries the `hv` terminal pass-through, the `hv_update` F3 firmware update and the `hv_verify` read back of the F3 flash. The F3 side of the link is the F3 `ls` component (stm32f303/src/comps/ls.c); the F3 bridge driver that shares this name is stm32f303/src/comps/hv.c, documented as page hv_f3.
*
* Typical wiring (conf/template/pid.txt + pmsm.txt): `hv0.en = fault0.en_out`, `hv0.sbrake = fault0.sbrake`, `hv0.sbrake_arm = fault0.sbrake_en`, `hv0.pos = angle0.pos`, `hv0.vel = angle0.vel`, `hv0.q_cmd = pmsm_ttc0.cur`, `hv0.d_cmd = pmsm_ttc0.id`, `hv0.scale = fault0.scale`, the motor constants from `conf0`, and `fault0.hv_error = hv0.fault`, `fault0.dc_volt = hv0.dc_volt`, `fault0.dc_cur = hv0.dc_cur`, `iit0.cur = hv0.abs_cur`. conf/template/id_pmsm.txt links the `emf_*` pins and `pwm_freq` to `idpmsm0`, the IPM templates (e.g. conf/template/ipm_im06b50gc1.txt) read `ipm0.f_sw = hv0.pwm_freq`, conf/template/id_tune.txt drives `drop_k` from `idtune0`.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* 1. **Link and packets**:
* - USART `UART_DRV` (USART2) at `DATABAUD` = 3 Mbaud, 8N1, 8x oversampling, TX and RX both by DMA (set up with the STM32CubeF4 LL drivers); packets use the stmbl_talk header with an STM32 hardware CRC32 (`crc_calc_block()`, inc/f4_ll_util.h) over everything after the CRC field.
* - F4 to F3 (`packet_to_hv_t`, 32 bytes): `d_cmd`, `q_cmd`, `pos`, `vel`, the flags `enable`, `cmd_type` (from `cmd_mode`), `phase_type` (from `phase_mode`), `ignore_fault_pin`, `sbrake`, `sbrake_arm`, one terminal byte, plus one config word (`conf_addr` + float).
* - F3 to F4 (`packet_from_hv_t`, 32 bytes): `id_fb`, `iq_fb`, `ud_fb`, `uq_fb`, `fault`, one terminal byte, plus one state word.
* - The exchange is one request/answer per rt period: the answer to the packet sent in period n is read at the start of period n+1.
* - Each period both DMA streams are stopped with `dma_stream_stop()` (inc/dma_util.h: waits until EN reads 0 and clears all five stream flags) before they are re-armed. The RX stream is sized for the larger bootloader packet, so it is usually stopped mid-transfer; its NDTR is set again before every re-arm.
*
* 2. **Commands sent (rt)**:
* - `pos` is advanced by `vel * adv` and wrapped with `mod()` before sending: `pos_sent = mod(pos + vel * adv)`. `adv` is meant to cover only the latency from the encoder reading to the F3 current sample: the F3 applies its output voltage at its own angle `ls0.pos_v = pos + vel * v_lead * period` (`v_lead` default 1.5 periods), so re-run id_tune after updating from older firmware, `adv` drops by about 100 us. `vel` is sent too; the F3 uses it to extrapolate `pos` between packets, for that voltage angle and for the BEMF decoupling of its current loop.
* - If `en > 0`, `d_cmd`/`q_cmd` are sent and the enable flag is set; otherwise both are sent as 0 and the F3 is disabled.
* - The F3 ignores the enable flag until it has received every config word once since its boot (`ls0.conf_ok`), so after an F3 reset the power stage stays off for at least one full config round (17 periods). The F3 also forgets the received words after 10 ms without packets (`LS_CONF_TICKS`), since a restarted F4 starts its round at word 0 again, so after a link loss the enable waits for a full round as well. This assumes the F4 and F3 images come from the same build (same config layout), which `hv_update` ensures.
* - `cmd_mode`: 0 = voltage mode (`d_cmd`/`q_cmd` in V), 1 = current mode (`d_cmd`/`q_cmd` in A peak, closed by the F3 current loop).
* - `phase_mode`: 0 = 90 deg 3 phase, 1 = 90 deg 4 phase, 2 = 120 deg 3 phase (normal 3 phase motor), 3 = 180 deg 2 phase (DC motor), 4 = 180 deg 3 phase.
* - `rev > 0` negates `q_cmd`, `pos` and `vel` on the way out and `iq_fb`, `uq_fb` on the way in, to reverse the output direction.
*
* 3. **Short-circuit braking flags**:
* - The `sbrake` flag is sent only while `en <= 0` and `sbrake > 0`: the F3 (io.c) then turns all three low sides on and chops the phase current at its `io0.sbrake_cur` (default `max_cur`, at most 0.8 x the overcurrent limit). It refuses after any trip since the last enable and stops for good on a trip while braking; that trip is reported in `fault` until the request goes away.
* - `sbrake_arm > 0` lets the F3 brake on its own (for its `ls0.sbrake_time`, default 1 s) when packets from the F4 stop while the motor was driven or already braking.
* - Both are wired from `fault0` (see the fault page for when it asks for braking). During an F3 update both flags are sent as 0.
*
* 4. **Config words (round robin)**:
* - The F3 current loop parameters are sent one word per packet, cycling through `r`, `l`, `psi`, `cur_bw`, `cur_ff`, `cur_ind`, `max_y`, `max_cur * scale`, `dac`, `drop_k`, `lq`, `emf_run`, `emf_sel`, `emf_pp`, `drop_knee`, an unused word (always 0, so an older F3 reads its removed observer as off) and `oc_cur` = `max_cur` (the layout of `f3_config_data_t` in shared/common.h, append only). A full update takes 17 rt periods.
* - `max_cur` is multiplied by `scale` (the fault component's derating, 0..1) before sending; on the F3 it is the current loop command limit. The software overcurrent trip follows the unscaled `max_cur` (`oc_cur`), so a derated limit cannot pull the trip under the current and cause fault 15.
* - `dac` is the raw 12 bit value (0..4095) of the F3 DAC that sets the hardware overcurrent comparator threshold.
* - `lq = 0` makes the F3 use `l` for both axes.
* - Dead time compensation (F3 hv, 120 deg 3 phase only): `drop_k` scales the ideal dead time loss (dead time / pwm period x DC link voltage), 0 = off. The F3 adds it to the phase voltages before it takes the SVM offset. In current mode the sign per phase comes from the commanded phase currents; in voltage mode it is off unless the F3's own `hv0.drop_volt > 0` (not sent over the link, off by default), which takes the sign from the measured dq current low passed with `hv0.drop_vlp` (3 ms). With `drop_knee = 0` the sign latches outside a current band; `drop_knee > 0` (A) instead scales each phase by `k(i) = 1 - 1/(1 + |i|/drop_knee)^2`, which fades out at low current and cannot stick.
* - `emf_run` (1 sum, 0 hold, -1 clear), `emf_sel` and `emf_pp` (pole pairs) drive the F3 `emf0` back EMF map, which sums the unfiltered phase voltages while the bridge is off and the rotor coasts; the result selected by `emf_sel` comes back in `emf_val`. Used by `idpmsm0`.
*
* 5. **Feedback (rt)**:
* - A received packet is only used if it is complete, its CRC matches, `slave_addr` is 0 and its length is that of `packet_from_hv_t`. Then `id_fb`, `iq_fb`, `ud_fb`, `uq_fb`, `fault` are copied, `abs_cur = sqrt(id_fb^2 + iq_fb^2)`, `abs_volt = sqrt(ud_fb^2 + uq_fb^2)` and `duty = abs_volt / pwm_volt` (only while `pwm_volt > 0`). `ud_fb`/`uq_fb` are the F3 `curpid0` output, which limits the voltage as one vector (d first, q gets what is left of the circle), so `abs_volt` stays at or below `pwm_volt`. The F3 computes `pwm_volt` from the DC link voltage and its usable duty `hv0.duty_max` (what the min on/off times leave, about 0.91), or 0.95 if that is not wired.
* - One state word per packet fills `u_fb`, `v_fb`, `w_fb`, `hv_temp`, `mot_temp`, `core_temp`, `dc_volt`, `pwm_volt`, `y`, `emf_val`, two unused words, `pwm_freq`, `link_to`, `hv_temp_ok` (`f3_state_data_t`, 15 words, so each is refreshed every 15 periods). A word address past this layout (from a newer F3 image) is ignored.
* - `pwm_freq` is the PWM and rt rate the F3 image was built for; an older F3 that does not report it reads as 15000 Hz. `link_to` counts the F3 rt ticks spent in link timeout since the F3 booted (`ls0.timeout`); every rise is a dropout that disabled the gates. A rise while `en` > 0 counts in `link_drops` and holds `fault` at `HV_TIMEOUT_ERROR` (9) until `en` drops, because the F3 times out after 2 packets (400 us) but the F4 only after 3 ticks, so a short dropout could otherwise stop the bridge without the F4 ever faulting. A fall in `link_to` (F3 reboot) is taken as the new baseline.
* - `power` and `dc_cur` are not measured, they are estimated from the commanded dq voltages, so they leave out inverter losses and read low:
* ```c
* power  = 0.5 * power + 0.5 * 1.5 * (ud_fb * id_fb + uq_fb * iq_fb);
* dc_cur = power / dc_volt;   // only updated while dc_volt > 1 V
* ```
* - Every failed CRC increments `crc_error` (never reset); it does not raise a fault.
*
* 6. **Timeout**:
* - A counter is reset by every valid packet; after more than 2 rt periods without one, `fault` is forced to `HV_TIMEOUT_ERROR` (9). All other codes in `fault` come from the F3 (`fault_t` in shared/common.h, e.g. `HV_TEMP_ERROR` 10, `HV_VOLT_ERROR` 11, `HV_FAULT_ERROR` 12, `HV_OVERCURRENT_*` 14..16).
*
* 7. **Terminal pass-through**:
* - The terminal command `hv_pause <ms>` (1 to 2000) stops sending to the F3 for that long, to test what the F3 does on its own on link loss (gates off, short brake if armed); the F4 faults `HV_TIMEOUT_ERROR` meanwhile. It does nothing during an `hv_update`.
* - The terminal command `hv <text>` queues the text plus newline into a 128 byte ring buffer; one byte is sent per packet to the F3 terminal. Bytes coming back from the F3 are printed by `nrt`.
*
* 8. **F3 firmware update (`hv_update`)**:
* - The F4 image contains the F3 application (obj_hvf3/hvf3.bin). The terminal command `hv_update` starts a state machine in `rt`, reported on `state`:
* - 0 `SLAVE_IN_APP`: normal operation.
* - 1 `SEND_TO_BOOTLOADER`: sends the BOOTLOADER command with the output disabled for 10 periods, the F3 resets into its bootloader.
* - 2 `ERASE_FLASH`: page erase request to slave address 255, repeated until an OK comes back (the F3 bootloader skips pages that are already blank on a repeat), gives up after 60000 periods (12 s; a full erase takes 1-2 s).
* - 3 `SEND_APP`: writes the image word by word to 0x08004000, each word must be acknowledged with the same address and value (10 period timeout per word). `nrt` prints the progress in percent.
* - 4 `CRC_CHECK`: asks the bootloader to verify the app CRC. The bootloader computes it in its timer interrupt (2-3 ms) and answers only then, so the request is sent once and then `CRC_LISTEN` (100) periods are listened before it is sent again. An OK goes on to 5, a NAK (CRC over the image not 0) to 6 with the message `the f3 bootloader says the app CRC is wrong`; no answer for 2000 periods also ends in 6 (`no answer to CRC_CHECK`).
* - 5 `SEND_TO_APP`: sends DO_RESET for 2000 periods, then back to 0.
* - 6 `FLASH_FAILED`: sends the bootloader a NOP every period. While the bootloader answers, it stays here (the F3 only starts its app after a reset with a valid CRC, so `fault` shows the timeout) and accepts `hv_update` and `hv_verify` directly; after 200 periods (40 ms) without an answer the F3 runs its app and the state returns to 0. A finished `hv_verify` also ends here, since the F3 answered from its bootloader.
* - 7 `VERIFY_FLASH`: see `hv_verify` below.
* - While updating, every second rt period sends nothing, to give the bootloader time to answer.
*
* 9. **F3 flash read back (`hv_verify`)**:
* - Accepted in state 0 or 6 (otherwise it prints `hv_verify: busy`). Meant for an F3 that sits in its bootloader after a failed `hv_update`: it reads the app area back word by word from 0x08004000 with the bootloader READ opcode and compares it with the embedded image, plus 8 words past its end, which must read as erased (0xFFFFFFFF).
* - `nrt` prints the progress every 10 %, then the number of differing words, the first 8 differences (address, F3 value, image value) and the `version_info` image CRC and size of the F3 flash next to those of the embedded image.
* - Without an answer for 200 periods (40 ms) it stops with `the f3 is not in its bootloader` and goes back to state 0.
*
* {{% hint info %}}
* `flash_state`, the update/verify state and the terminal buffers are global, so only one `hv` instance works. `max_y` is transmitted but not used by the current F3 firmware. `value`, `uart_sr` and `uart_dr` are debug outputs.
