/**
* ## Brief
* `idacim` identifies an AC induction motor. A standstill test measures the stator resistance `r` (with the inverter dead time voltage `drop` separated from it), the leakage inductance `l` (sigma*Ls) by injection at two frequencies around the current loop's crossover, and the rotor time constant `tr` and rotor side magnetizing inductance `lmr` (Lm^2/Lr) by d current steps; an optional current ladder (`knee`) fits how tr changes with flux. From these and the motor plate it computes a `vf` parameter set. An optional rotating test spins the rotor open loop, sweeps the flux at two speeds and fits the magnetizing curve (`acim_flux0.lmr`, `lmr_sat`, `i_knee`, `tr_sat`, `i_dip`, `lmr_dip`, `acim_foc0.id_n`) and, with an encoder, the inertia. The pole pair test is still there. It runs on the F4 board, drives `hv0` directly and is loaded by the `id_acim` template.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* 1. **Before you start**:
* - `test_cur` (peak A, default 8) is the highest current of the standstill test and must be under `conf0.max_ac_cur`. The r chord's dead time correction needs every phase above about 2 A in the lower dwell (`test_cur / 2` on d is `-test_cur / 4` on v and w), and the rotor test steps between the same two levels, so `lmr` and `ls` are read over `test_cur / 2 .. test_cur`. No test level should go under `i_min` (default 4 A), where the dead time distorts the voltage: the console warns if `test_cur < 2 * i_min`. For the V/f set, a `test_cur` near the resulting `id_n` is best (the report says when to rerun).
* - If you have a four wire measurement of the winding resistance, set `idacim0.r_known` to it: r is then taken as given and only the dead time drop is read.
* - For the V/f set give the plate: `n_volt` (line to line rms V), `n_freq` (Hz), `n_cur` (rms A) and `n_pp` (pole pairs). Without all four the V/f set is skipped; the rotating test needs at least `n_freq` and `n_pp`, and the tr knee fit needs `id_n` from the V/f set.
* - `spin = 1` goes on to the rotating test after the standstill test. That test turns the rotor, so the shaft must be free and unloaded.
* - `knee = 1` adds the tr ladder to the rotor test (see 5.). It needs `test_cur >= 1.5 * i_min / 0.7` (about 8.6 A with the default `i_min`), otherwise the console says there is no range and no ladder runs.
* - The template sets `hv0.drop_k = 0` (no dead time compensation) for the run: the r fit and the dead time drop are read from `ud_fb`.
* - While the state is 0 the nrt function resets `r` 0.1 ohm, `l` 1 mH, `drop` 0, `r_ok`, `l_ok`, `tr_ok` and `out_rev` 0, `cur_bw` 1. The parameters keep their values.
*
* 2. **How to run it**:
* - At the console, `link id_acim`. The template loads `idacim` and wires `idacim0.en = fault0.en_out`, sets `fault0.pos_error = 0` and `pid0.en = 0`, connects `hv0.en`, `cur_bw`, `cmd_mode`, `d_cmd`, `q_cmd`, `pos`, `rev`, `r`, `l` to this component (`hv0.lq = 0`) and `hv0.ud_fb`, `id_fb`, `uq_fb`, `iq_fb`, `pwm_volt`, `dc_volt`, `conf0.cur_bw` (as `loop_bw`) and `vel1.vel` back into it. `hv0.r` / `hv0.l` are this component's `r` / `l`, so they are the current loop's plant model during the tests.
* - Enable the drive. The rotor may stay free for the standstill test: a dc field and a single pulsating axis make no torque on a cage. The state goes `0` -> `1.0` -> `1.1` and the console asks for `idacim0.state = 1.2`. `en` low returns to `0` from any state.
* - The standstill test runs r (`1.2`, 4 s), leakage (`1.3`, a few s) and the rotor test (`1.4`, about `(1 + 2 * rot_cycles) * rot_half` at most, shorter once tr is known, plus each ladder rung). State `1.5` prints the results and goes to `3.0` (done), to `4.0` if `spin` is set, or back to `0` if r failed. Append the printed lines to the config and save.
* - Rotating test: `4.0` (set it by hand after a standstill test in the same enable, or via `spin`) checks that `tr_ok`, `n_freq` and `n_pp` are there and asks for `idacim0.state = 4.2`. It ends in `5.0`.
* - Pole pair test: set `idacim0.state = 2` by hand; it asks to unblock the rotor and for `idacim0.state = 2.2`, and ends in `3.0`.
*
* 3. **Resistance (`state` 1.2)**:
* - Current mode, `cur_bw` 1, current on the d axis at `com_pos = 0`: 2 s at `test_cur`, then 2 s at `test_cur / 2`. `id_fb` / `ud_fb` of each dwell are low-passed (0.001 per tick) into `tmp2` / `tmp3` (top) and `tmp0` / `tmp1` (half). Meanwhile `r` tracks `ud_fb / id_fb` so the current loop can build up voltage at all.
* - `ud_fb` contains `r * id + 4/3 * drop` (dead time; at angle 0 the phase currents are id, -id/2, -id/2). After 4 s `fit_di = tmp2 - tmp0` and the chord `r_2p = (tmp3 - tmp1) / fit_di` (only if `fit_di > 0.01` A) are computed, and `r` is taken from one of two modes:
* - `r_known > 0`: `r = r_known`, `drop = 0.75 * (tmp3 - r * tmp2)`. Needs the top dwell to reach half of `test_cur`.
* - default: `r = r_2p - r_bias` with `r_bias = drop_slope * dc_volt / test_cur` (0 if `dc_volt` is not wired), `drop` as above. The dead time drop rises roughly as ln(i), which biases the chord; `drop_slope` (0.0039 ohm A per volt) was fitted on one bridge.
* - `r_ok` is set if the chosen mode produced a value. Then `avg_test_volt = r * test_cur + 4/3 * drop` (limited to `pwm_volt / 2`) and the state goes to `1.3`, or straight to `1.5` if `r_ok` is 0.
*
* 4. **Leakage inductance (`state` 1.3)**:
* - Voltage mode, `cur_bw` 1: `d_cmd = avg_test_volt + amp * sin(w t)`. The dc bias holds about `test_cur` on d, so every phase current stays on one side of zero and the dead time is only an offset. The first settle is 1 s (the bias settles on the slow rotor pole), after a frequency change 0.2 s.
* - The pair of frequencies sits on either side of the current loop's crossover `f_c = loop_bw / 2 pi` (`loop_bw` is `conf0.cur_bw`, 1000 if 0): `l_freq_a` and `l_freq_b` default to 0, meaning 0.75 and 1.5 `f_c` (120 / 240 Hz at a `cur_bw` of 1000). Both are rounded to multiples of 20 Hz, so every window holds whole cycles, and kept within 20 Hz .. `0.2 / period`. The leakage of a cage rotor has no plateau over frequency, so this is the band `conf0.l` has to describe.
* - At each frequency 4 blocks of 50 ms size the amplitude so the injected current is `l_ripple * test_cur` (default 0.15), then 0.4 s demodulate `ud_fb` and `id_fb` into the impedance `l_za` / `l_zb` (corrected for the zero order hold of the command) and the current reached, `l_ia` / `l_ib`. No resistance goes in:
* ```c
* l * l = (zb * zb - za * za) / (wb * wb - wa * wa);
* ```
* - `l_res` is the resistance (stator plus cage) the pair implies. `l_ok` needs a positive l^2 and both currents within 0.5..2 times the target. If the reactance at the upper frequency is under `2 * l_res` (small leakage, as on high speed spindles), the pair moves up an octave, at most 3 times and while the upper one stays under `0.2 / period`; `l_fa` / `l_fb` are the pair used.
* - `l = sqrt(l^2)` if `l_ok`, else 1 mH (then measure line to line near 150 Hz with an LCR meter and halve it). The state goes to `1.4`.
*
* 5. **Rotor time constant and magnetizing inductance (`state` 1.4)**:
* - Current mode at `cur_bw = rot_bw` (default 1500 rad/s), `com_pos = 0`: `d_cmd` steps between `test_cur` and `test_cur / 2`, `1 + 2 * rot_cycles` levels (`rot_cycles` default 4, at most 16). The first level only magnetizes. Each level lasts `rot_half` (default 1.5 s) until an edge has given a tr, then `16 * tr` of the last fit (at least 0.1 s).
* - The rotor flux follows the stator current with `tr = Lr/Rr`, and its emf `lmr * d(i_mr)/dt` appears in `ud_fb` on top of `r * id`, the dead time and `l * d(id)/dt`. Integrated from the edge, with `c` the offset `ud - r id` where the edge settles:
* ```c
* lam(t) = integral(ud - r * id - c) - l * (id - i0) = lmr * (i_mr - i0);
* integral(lam) = lmr * integral(id - i0) - tr * lam;
* ```
* - This is fitted by least squares on the current that actually flowed, from `rot_t0` (default 15 ms, skips the current loop's settling, kept under `tr / 5`) to the end of the edge, with `lmr`, `tr` and the edge's own offset `c` as unknowns (Gauss-Newton in nrt, started from the median of 8 block means over the last quarter). `r_2p` (or `r`) is used for r, because the chord takes the dead time out at exactly these two levels. A median of three filters single bad samples; the sums take every 8th tick. An edge counts if it moves the current by more than 10 % of the level; nrt prints one `# edge` line per edge.
* - At the end the rising and falling edges are reduced apart: `tr_rise` / `tr_fall` are their medians, `tr` their mean (this cancels the asymmetry a step into saturation causes), `tr_spread` the worse direction's (max - min) / median, `tr_min` / `tr_max` the extremes. `lmr` is the median of the falling edges only (rising ones read low near saturation). `tr_ok` if `tr` is over `5 * period` and under the start of the last edge's settled tail (0.75 of its length); then `slip_n = 1 / tr` and `ls = l + lmr`, otherwise these are 0 (`tr` is reported either way). `rot_n` is the number of fitted edges, `rot_dip` the largest current error at `rot_t0` as a fraction of the step.
* - Offset ladder (`lad_top > 0`): after the main test, rung k of `lad_n` (at most 4) repeats the steps between its top and `lad_ratio` times it (0 = 0.5, else clamped 0.3..0.9), and stores its top current, `lmr` slope, `tr` and spread in `lad_i`, `lad_lm`, `lad_tr`, `lad_sp`. The tops are `lad_top * k / lad_n`, or with `lad_bot > 0` evenly from `lad_bot` to `lad_top`.
* - `knee = 1` (with `lad_top` 0) writes the ladder itself at the start of a run: `lad_ratio` 0.7, `lad_bot = max(0.4 * test_cur, i_min / 0.7)`, `lad_top = test_cur`, `lad_n` 4, and records it in `lad_auto`. A ladder the knee wrote is replaced or dropped on the next run; one set by hand stays.
*
* 6. **Report and V/f set (`state` 1.5, nrt)**:
* - Waits until nrt has reduced the last rung. If `r_ok`: prints `conf0.r`, `conf0.l` (or why l failed), and if `tr_ok` also `acim_flux0.tr`, `acim_flux0.lmr` and the slip for `acim_ttc` (`vel_n = (2 pi freq_n - slip_n) / polecount`), with warnings for `tr_spread > 0.25` and `rot_dip > 0.1` (raise `rot_bw`).
* - With `tr_ok` and all four plate pins the V/f set: `u = n_volt * sqrt(2/3)`, `w = 2 pi n_freq`, `id_n = u / sqrt(r^2 + w^2 ls^2)`, `iq_n = sqrt((sqrt(2) n_cur)^2 - id_n^2)`. It prints `conf0.polecount = n_pp` and `vf0.u_n = u`, `vf0.vel_n = w / n_pp`, `vf0.u_boost = r * id_n + drop` (the dead time drop is added because V/f runs in volt mode with no dead time compensation), `vf0.boost_vel` (where `w ls = 3 r`, clamped to 2..20 % of `w`, per pole pair), `vf0.slip_n = iq_n / (tr * id_n) / n_pp`, `vf0.cur_n = iq_n`, and `acim_foc0.id_n` as a start value. The same values are on the `vf_*`, `id_n` and `iq_n` pins.
* - With a ladder it prints a table per rung (range, lmr slope, tr, spread; with `lad_bot` 0 and `lad_ratio` 0.5 also psi_r and the secant lmr, integrated from the slopes), then the tr knee fit: acim_flux's model `tr * (1 + tr_sat * x)`, `x = (id_n - i) / (id_n - i_knee)` clamped 0..1, fitted over the rungs (only those with an lmr, a lower current of at least `i_min` and spread up to 0.3, each at the middle of its range) and the main test (at `0.75 * test_cur`), weighted by 1 / spread^2, for every `i_knee` from 0 to 0.9 `id_n` in 1 % steps. It needs `id_n` and three levels. It is rejected if `tr_sat` is outside 0..1 or tr at `id_n` is more than 30 % off the main test's tr; otherwise `knee_i`, `knee_tr_sat`, `knee_tr` are set and it prints `acim_flux0.tr` (tr at `id_n`, replacing the one above), `acim_flux0.i_knee` and `acim_flux0.tr_sat`.
* - Then the dead time `drop`, which is also part of `vf0.u_boost`.
* - If `r_ok` is 0 it prints why the r test failed and returns to state 0 (with `en` still high, straight back to the 1.1 prompt).
*
* 7. **Rotating test (`state` 4.2 to 4.7), rotor free, no load**:
* - Current mode at `cur_bw = rot_bw`, `d_cmd = id_n` (or `test_cur` without the V/f set), and `com_pos` turns open loop. `4.2`: the field ramps at `rot_acc` (0 = plate speed in 5 s) to `rot_vel` (default 0.4, clamped 0.05..0.45) of plate speed and holds 1 s. If `vel_fb` is within 20 % of the field, `rot_enc = 1`; if the rotor turns but lags more, it pulled out and the test ends.
* - `4.3` flux sweep: d current at 1.15, 1.0, 0.9, 0.75, 0.6, 0.45, 0.35, 0.25 of `id_n`, from the top down, limited to `i_min` .. `0.85 * sqrt(2) * n_cur` (levels that would repeat a limit are skipped; without an encoder it stops at 0.45). Each level settles `max(6 tr, 0.3 s)` and averages 0.5 s. At no load `uq = r iq + w psi_s`, so the rotor flux is `(uq - r iq) / w - l id`; with an encoder it is corrected for the slip angle (with tr scaled by the point's own lmr). A point with slip x tr over 0.35 is dropped and ends the pass; a filtered slip x tr over 1 (near pull out) ends it too.
* - With an encoder the same levels are read again at half the speed: an offset du on uq reads as du / w in the flux, so `lmr = (w1 psi1 - w2 psi2) / (w1 i1 - w2 i2)` takes it out. Before each speed change the current goes back to `id_n` and the flux settles. Results in rising order in `sw_i` / `sw_psi` (`sw_n` points, at most 8).
* - `4.4` inertia, only with `rot_enc`: hold, ramp up to `min(2 rot_vel, 0.9)` of plate speed, hold 0.5 s, ramp down. Over the middle half of each ramp the air gap torque (stator power less copper loss, over field speed), the slip and the acceleration of `vel_fb` are averaged; up minus down cancels friction. A slip x tr over 1 ends the ramps (pulled out).
* - `4.6` ramps the field down to 0, `4.7` (nrt) reports and goes to `5.0`: `rot_id_n`, the d current where the stator flux reaches `n_volt` at `n_freq` (interpolated from the sweep, or `id_n` without `n_volt`), and `rot_lmr`, the secant there, printed as `acim_foc0.id_n`, `acim_flux0.i_n` and `acim_flux0.lmr`.
* - Magnetizing curve: with at least 3 points under 0.95 `id_n` the secant lmr is fitted to acim_flux's shape `lmr * (1 + lmr_sat * x) * (1 - lmr_dip * y)`, `x = (id_n - i) / (id_n - i_knee)`, `y = (i_dip - i) / i_dip`, both clamped 0..1 (growth as the iron desaturates down to the knee, flat, then a fall under `i_dip` at low induction), over a grid of `i_knee` and `i_dip <= i_knee` starting at the lowest point; terms that come out negative are dropped. The fit is used only with an encoder, `lmr_sat <= 1`, `lmr_dip <= 0.5` and its lmr at `id_n` within 5 % of `rot_lmr`: then it prints `acim_flux0.lmr_sat`, `i_knee`, `tr_sat` (= `lmr_sat`), `i_dip` and `lmr_dip` (`rot_lmr_sat`, `rot_i_knee`, `rot_i_dip`, `rot_lmr_dip`). `acim_flux0.tr_dip` is not fitted: it defaults to 0 (tr does not change below `i_dip`), so set it by hand, to `lmr_dip` for tr to follow lmr or negative where tr rises at low flux. Otherwise `lmr_sat` comes from a straight line through the lowest point at or above 0.4 `id_n` and no knee or dip is set. Without an encoder that `lmr_sat` is printed to append (at least 0); with an encoder it is only printed as a comment, because the line runs through the dip and does not fit the config's knee and dip, which stay.
* - With the inertia ramps also `rot_j` (from the air gap torque, printed as `conf0.j`), `rot_j_s` (the same from the slip and tr, offset by any lag of the speed feedback, which is printed) and the friction torque `rot_tf`.
*
* 8. **Pole pairs and direction (`state` 2.2), rotor free**:
* - `2.0` (nrt) clears `pp` and asks for `idacim0.state = 2.2`. For 3 s: current mode, `cur_bw` 100, `d_cmd = test_cur`, and `com_pos` advances open loop at `test_vel` (default 50) electrical rad/s, dragging the rotor along. While `abs(vel_fb) > 0.1` rad/s, `pp` is low-passed (0.005 per tick, starting from the first reading) from `test_vel / vel_fb`. At the end a negative `pp` sets `out_rev = 1`, and `pp` is rounded to an integer.
* - `2.4` (nrt) prints `conf0.polecount` and, if reversed, `conf0.out_rev = 1`, and goes to `3.0` (done).
*
* {{% hint warning %}}
* `drop` is a voltage per phase; it goes into `vf0.u_boost` but is not a value for `hv0.drop_k` (a fraction). `conf0.l` here is the leakage, right for `acim_foc` (which carries the rotor flux in `hv0.psi`); `acim_ttc` has no flux term, so with it iq falls short at speed. `tr` is the rotor's at the test's temperature and flux: a hot cage reads shorter. The rotating test uses `r`, `l`, `tr` and `lmr` from the pins and needs `tr_ok`; `en` low resets `r` and `l` to 0.1 ohm / 1 mH and clears `tr_ok`, so run it in the same enable as the standstill test. Without an encoder the sweep is not corrected for slip, so drag reads as saturation at the low points. In the pole pair test the rotor slips behind the field, so `test_vel / vel_fb` reads slightly high before rounding.

      // earlier visit to the level, one bad sample or a cage warming between

      // read off the edge's last quarter, a few mV of it still spread them
      // 30% (5 Oct). The integration takes out c0, the previous edge's offset
