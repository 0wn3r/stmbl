/**
* ## Brief
* `idpmsm` identifies a permanent magnet synchronous motor on the drive itself: winding resistance `r` together with the inverter dead time curve (`hv0.drop_k`, `hv0.drop_knee`), d and q inductance `ld`/`lq`, pole pairs `pp`, feedback direction `out_rev`, commutation offset `com_offset` (plus `com_fb_offset` for a commutation track such as `encf`'s) and flux linkage `psi` (plus a per pole back emf map from the F3's `emf0`). It runs on the F4 board and is loaded by the `id_pmsm` config template, which takes over `hv0` (enable, command mode, d/q commands, commutation angle, `r`, `l`, `lq`, current loop bandwidth) and prints the results as `conf0.*` and `hv0.*` lines to append to the config.
*
* ## How to run it
*
* 1. Have a working base config with the motor feedback set up (`fb_switch0.mot_abs_fb_no_offset` and `vel1.vel` must be valid), the load off the shaft and the drive disabled.
* 2. In the servoterm type `link id_pmsm`. The template does `load idpmsm` and wires:
* ```
* idpmsm0.en = fault0.en_out
* hv0.en = idpmsm0.en_out
* hv0.cur_bw = idpmsm0.cur_bw
* idpmsm0.loop_bw = conf0.cur_bw
* hv0.cmd_mode = idpmsm0.cmd_mode
* hv0.d_cmd = idpmsm0.d_cmd
* hv0.q_cmd = idpmsm0.q_cmd
* hv0.pos = idpmsm0.com_pos
* hv0.rev = idpmsm0.out_rev
* hv0.r = idpmsm0.r
* hv0.l = idpmsm0.l
* hv0.lq = idpmsm0.lq
* hv0.drop_k = 0
* hv0.emf_run = idpmsm0.emf_run
* hv0.emf_sel = idpmsm0.emf_sel
* hv0.emf_pp = idpmsm0.emf_pp
* idpmsm0.emf_val = hv0.emf_val
* idpmsm0.pos_fb = fb_switch0.mot_abs_fb_no_offset
* idpmsm0.mot_state = fb_switch0.mot_state_fb
* idpmsm0.com_fb = fb_switch0.com_fb_no_offset
* idpmsm0.com_rev = conf0.com_fb_rev
* idpmsm0.com_polecount = conf0.com_fb_polecount
* idpmsm0.vel_fb = vel1.vel
* relink
* ```
* - plus `ud_fb`, `uq_fb`, `id_fb`, `iq_fb`, `pwm_volt`, `dc_volt`, `pwm_freq`, `u_fb`, `v_fb` from `hv0`. It also sets `fault0.pos_error = 0`, `fault0.sat = 0` and `pid0.en = 0` so the position loop and its faults stay out of the way. The final `relink` flattens chained links (`a = b`, `b = c` becomes `a = c`): links typed at runtime are not flattened like the boot config, and without it `idpmsm0.com_polecount` would read `conf0.com_fb_polecount`'s own value instead of `conf0.polecount` through it. Dead time compensation is forced off: the r test fits the uncompensated loss.
* 3. Optionally change `idpmsm0.test_cur`, `idpmsm0.test_vel`, `idpmsm0.r_known` etc. (see below). `test_cur` must be below `conf0.max_ac_cur`.
* 4. Enable the drive. `en` going high moves `state` from 0 to 1.0 and the tests start. With the default `auto_step = 4.2` all three steps run back to back; with a lower `auto_step` the component stops at 1.1, 2.1 or 3.1, prints a prompt and waits for you to type `idpmsm0.state = 1.2` (or 2.2, 3.2). The r test alone takes about 50 s.
* 5. Copy the printed `conf0.r`, `conf0.l`, `conf0.lq`, `hv0.drop_k`, `hv0.drop_knee`, `conf0.polecount`, `conf0.mot_fb_offset`, `conf0.com_fb_offset` (only with a commutation track), `conf0.out_rev` and `conf0.psi` lines into the config. Lines printed in red, or after a "failed" message, are not measurements.
* 6. Disable the drive and reload the normal config. Disabling puts `state` back to 0, and `nrt` then resets most result pins to their init values, so the numbers are only kept in the printed text.
*
* Afterwards run `link id_tune` (component `idtune`) to find `hv0.adv` (it keeps the `hv0.drop_k` printed here when `hv0.drop_knee > 0`), then `id_mot`.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* `state` is a step number: `rt` does the timed measuring in states 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.2; `nrt` does the setup, the r fit, the prompts and the printing in states 0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.4, 2.0, 2.4 to 2.6, 3.0 and 3.3. `en <= 0` forces `state = 0` in every rt cycle, which sets `en_out = 0`, clears the commands and `cur_bw = 1`. `rt_start` clears the internal context so a restarted run never continues half a measurement. `emf_pp` always follows `|pp|`.
*
* Defaults from `nrt_init`: `test_cur = 6` A, `test_vel = 50` rad/s, `l_freq = 0` (= `loop_bw / 2 pi`, 480 Hz at `cur_bw` 3000), `l_ripple = 0.15`, `dt_ideal = 0` (= 2 us * `pwm_freq`), `ki = 1`, `vel_bw = 250`, `cur_bw = 1`, `auto_step = 4.2`, `r_known = 0`.
*
* 1. **Resistance and dead time curve (state 1.2, current mode)**:
* - First 2 s at `cur_bw = 1`: `d_cmd = test_cur` at `com_pos = 0`. Because `hv0.r` is wired to `r`, `r` is bootstrapped as a filtered `ud_fb / id_fb` so current flows at all; the full current first also aligns the rotor at the strongest field.
* - The bootstrap `r` carries the dead time volts (about 2.3x the winding on X at 12 A), and the loop's integral gain is `cur_bw * r`, so the later steps to `test_cur` would overshoot into the F3's peak current trip. So at the first dwell `r` is replaced by `r_known` when given, else, after the first two dwells (1 and 0.67 `test_cur` at angle 0), by the slope `(u0 - u1) / (i0 - i1)` clamped to 0.01 .. the bootstrap value (only if the currents differ by > 0.1 A); the dead time loss is nearly flat there and cancels.
* - Then, at `cur_bw = 300`, 28 dwells: at each of the four angles `com_pos` = 0, pi, pi/2, -pi/2 (pairs half a turn apart give each current both signs through the same phases) the d current steps through 1, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.17, 0.1 times `test_cur`. Each dwell settles 1 s (2 s for the first at each angle) and averages `id_fb` and `ud_fb` for 0.5 s. Each new angle after the first starts with 0.2 s at 0 A (inside its settle time), so the angle jump and the step to `test_cur` are apart.
* - With `hv0.drop_k = 0`, `ud_fb` carries the winding drop plus the dead time loss, modelled as hv.c's compensation curve: each phase loses `V0 * sign(i) * k(i)` with `k(i) = 1 - 1 / (1 + |i| / knee)^2`, and `dproj` is what those three losses put on d:
* ```c
* ud = r * id + V0 * dproj(id, com_pos, knee);
* ```
* - State 1.5 (nrt, the fit is too slow for a tick; bridge off): a grid over `knee` from 0.05 to 2.0 A in 0.025 A steps, at each knee a least squares fit of `r` and `V0` (of `V0` alone, with `r = r_known`, when `r_known > 0`); the knee with the smallest residual wins. Results: `dt_v0`, `dt_knee`, `dt_rms` (residual), `dt_top` (largest top dwell current) and `dt_k = dt_v0 / (dt_ideal * dc_volt)` (0 if `dc_volt` is not wired; `dt_ideal = 0` uses 2 us * `pwm_freq`).
* - Choosing `r_known`: with `r_known` > 0 the r stage runs with it from the first dwell (no slope bootstrap), the fit finds only the dead time curve (`V0` -> `drop_k`, and the knee) and the printed `conf0.r` is `r_known`. The drive's own IGBT and shunt slope (a few tens of mOhm) then ends up in the dead time curve, so no drive-fitted `r` is needed for the compensation. Use the per phase resistance of a Y winding, line to line / 2, measured at the drive end of the motor cable with the cable connected (the cable is in the current loop too), cold, with the temperature noted (copper +0.393 %/K; a 6 A run warms the winding about 3 %). A lead-nulled DMM reading is good enough; a four wire reading (bench supply 2-3 A through U-V, voltage sensed at the cable ends, `r = V_UV / (2 I)`, both polarities averaged, all three pairs within 1 %) only tightens the last 1-2 %. A fixed `r_known` is steadier than the fit, which reads high at higher `test_cur` as the winding heats (X: 0.659 at 6 A cold, 0.769 at 12 A), so use it for runs at 12 A.
* - `r_ok` needs `dt_top > test_cur / 2`, `r > 0.001` and `V0 >= 0`. If yes, `r` takes the fit and `avg_test_volt = r * test_cur + V0 * dproj(test_cur, 0, knee)` (limited to `pwm_volt / 2`) is kept as the bias voltage for the l test and the state goes to 1.3, otherwise straight to the report 1.4.
*
* 2. **Ld and Lq by sine injection (state 1.3, voltage mode, `cur_bw = 1`)**:
* - `d_cmd = avg_test_volt` holds about `test_cur` on d at `com_pos = 0`, which keeps every phase current on one side of zero so the dead time is a constant offset; a sine of `l_freq` (0: `loop_bw / 2 pi`, the current loop's crossover where the loop uses l; `loop_bw` 0 = 1000 rad/s; clamped to 20 Hz .. 0.2 / period and rounded to whole cycles of the measuring window, reported as `l_f`) is added first on `d_cmd`, then on `q_cmd`.
* - Per axis: 0.1 s settle, four 50 ms blocks that scale the amplitude (starting at 1 V; q starts from d's) until the current ripple is `l_ripple * test_cur` (amplitude kept within 0.2 V .. `pwm_volt / 4`), then about 0.4 s (whole cycles) of demodulation of voltage and current at the injection frequency, with the dc bias taken out.
* - The impedance `z = v1 / i1`, corrected for the zero order hold of the F3's 5 kHz command, gives
* ```c
* l = sqrt(z*z - r*r) / (2 * pi * f);   // 0 if z <= r
* ```
* - Results: `ld`, `lq` and the amplitudes `l_vd`, `l_id`, `l_vq`, `l_iq`. `l_ok = 1` if both inductances are > 0 and both current amplitudes landed within 0.5 .. 2 times the target ripple. Then `l = ld` (0 if not ok).
*
* 3. **Report (state 1.4, nrt)**:
* - Prints `conf0.r`, and if `l_ok` `conf0.l` (= Ld) and `conf0.lq`, else how much current the injection drew. Then `hv0.drop_k` and `hv0.drop_knee` to append, and the fit's `V0`, link voltage, knee and residual.
* - Goes to 2.0 if `r_ok`, else prints the top dwell current reached and goes to 9.0. State 9.0 has no rt case: the bridge stays off until the drive is disabled.
*
* 4. **Pole pairs and direction (state 2.2, current mode, `cur_bw = 100`, 4 s)**:
* - `d_cmd = test_cur` and the field angle `com_pos` is turned open loop, ramping from 0 to `test_vel` electrical rad/s in 1 s so the rotor can follow.
* - From 1.5 s to 4 s the field angle and the rotor angle (integral of `vel_fb`) are summed; `pp_raw = field / rotor`. A negative ratio sets `out_rev = 1` and the sign is dropped; `pp` is then rounded.
* - `pp_ok` needs the rotor turning (`|vel_fb| > 0.1`) in more than 90% of the window, a rounded value of 1 .. 24 and less than 0.15 away from an integer. On failure the state goes to 2.4 (message: lower `test_vel` or raise `test_cur`, then 9.0).
* - State 2.0 (before the rotor moves) prints a red warning if `mot_state` (`fb_switch0.mot_state_fb`) is not 3: the offsets are then relative to power-up.
* - Throughout the test the commutation track `com_fb` is followed tick by tick: its total movement and its largest single step (both in the track's own angle units, via `minus()`) are kept. This decides in step 5 whether a track is present and whether it is coarse.
*
* 5. **Commutation offset (state 2.3, 2 s)**:
* - `d_cmd = test_cur` at `com_pos = 0` so the rotor parks on the d axis. Over the second half of the dwell the unit vector of `pos_fb` is summed into `off_sin`/`off_cos` (`off_n` samples), a circular mean so the wrap at +-pi does not matter.
* - `com_offset = -atan2(off_sin, off_cos)`, folded into `[0, 2*pi/pp)` so the same axis always prints the same number. `off_mag` is the resultant length (1 = rotor held still).
* - `com_ok` needs `off_mag > 0.98` and `id_fb > test_cur / 2`. Success goes to 2.5 which prints `conf0.polecount`, `conf0.mot_fb_offset` and, if reversed, `conf0.out_rev = 1`; failure goes to 2.6 (message, then 9.0).
* - **Commutation track offset** (same dwell): the track is summed as an electrical angle, `com_fb * pp / cpp` with `cpp = com_polecount` (or `pp` if `com_polecount` < 1). At the end, if the track moved more than pi in the pp test:
* ```c
* com_fb_offset = -atan2(com_sin, com_cos) * cpp / pp;   // negated again if com_rev > 0
* ```
* - This is the `com_offset` for `fb_switch`, which commutates from `mod((com_abs_pos + com_offset) * polecount / com_polecount)` (both reversed under `com_rev`) while the motor feedback is not absolute. `com_fb_ok` = 1 for a fine track, 2 if a single step was over 0.5 rad (halls: the value can be up to 30 deg electrical off), 0 if the track did not move (no track; `com_fb_offset` = 0). With `com_fb_ok` > 0 state 2.5 also prints `conf0.com_fb_offset` (plus a note for a coarse track).
*
* 6. **Flux linkage psi (state 3.2, current mode, `cur_bw = 250`)**:
* - Commutation now closes on the feedback: `com_pos = mod((pos_fb + com_offset) * pp)`, `d_cmd = 0`. A speed loop drives `q_cmd` from the mechanical `vel_fb`; the clamp slews only the integrator, the P term acts on the unclamped error:
* ```c
* vel_error = LIMIT(v_t - vel_fb, test_vel / 100);
* cur_sum   = LIMIT(cur_sum + ki * vel_error * period, test_cur);
* q_cmd     = LIMIT(vel_bw * period * (v_t - vel_fb) + cur_sum, test_cur);
* ```
* - Stages: spin up to `test_vel / 2` (mechanical rad/s), 2 s dwell, spin up to `test_vel`, 2 s dwell, then coast. A spin up is done when the filtered speed (50 ms) stays within 15% for 0.5 s; more than 8 s fails. A filtered speed under 10% of the target while `|cur_sum| > test_cur / 2` counts as a stall, which catches a wrong `pp` or offset.
* - The dwells record `uq - r * iq`, `iq` and speed. They are not used for psi (they contain the dead time); after the coast they give `udt_lo`/`udt_hi` = `uq - r iq - pp vel psi` (dead time volts on q) at the currents `idt_lo`/`idt_hi` and speeds `vel_lo`/`vel_hi`.
* - Coast: `en_out = 0`, the rotor runs down and the line voltage `u_fb - v_fb` is demodulated against the commutation angle, correcting the F3's `io.c` input filter (alpha = 750 / `pwm_freq`, 0.05 at 15 kHz) and the zero order hold of the F3 state block (`u_fb`/`v_fb` refresh only every `sizeof(f3_state_data_t) / 4` rt periods, which scales the emf by `sinc(w T / 2)`; the hold's delay stays in `emf_delay`). Sampling starts 50 ms after the bridge drops, so the freewheeling winding current has died. Samples are split into a fast band (> 0.6 `test_vel`) and a slow band (0.2 .. 0.6 `test_vel`); the coast ends below 0.2 `test_vel` or after 4 s. Each band needs 200 samples.
* - Results: `psi` (both bands, clamped to 0.001 .. 1 Vs), `psi_hi`, `psi_lo`, `emf_angle` (back emf phase against the commutation angle, extrapolated to standstill, electrical degrees) and `emf_delay` (s). The report compares `emf_angle` with the expected 120 deg (60 deg with `out_rev`) as an offset check with no current in it. `psi_ok = 1` on success.
* - Per pole map: during the coast `emf_run = 1` (it is -1, clear, while spinning up) makes the F3's `emf0` sum every pwm period's sample into `2 * pp` pole bins. After the coast `emf_run = 0` and `emf_sel` steps through emf0's results, one every 20 ms, read back on `emf_val`: `emf_psi` (whole coast), `emf_h5`/`emf_h7` (5th and 7th harmonic, % of the fundamental), `pole_min`, `pole_max` and `pole_spread` (% of the mean). A demagnetised pole reads low in its bin on every run. `emf_ok = 1` if the map came back with samples in every bin.
* - State 3.3 prints `conf0.psi` and the diagnostics: with `emf_ok` the printed `conf0.psi` is `emf_psi` (the F3 map sums every pwm sample with no filter or hold in it) and the F4 coast `psi` is shown as a cross-check, otherwise it is `psi`. On failure it prints the reason (stall, speed never settled, too few coast samples), then goes to 3.4 where it idles with the bridge off.
*
* 7. **Other states**:
* - `state = 10` only keeps `com_pos = mod((pos_fb + com_offset) * pp)` updated; it sets nothing else.
*
* {{% hint warning %}}
* - `test_vel` means two things: the pp test turns the field at `test_vel` electrical rad/s, while the psi test holds `test_vel / 2` and `test_vel` of mechanical speed (`vel_fb`).
* - The knee grid ends at 0.05 and 2.0 A; a fit on an edge prints a red warning, then keep the old `hv0.drop_k` and `hv0.drop_knee` if the residual is large. Without `dc_volt` wired, `hv0.drop_k` is not printed.
* - The `mot_state` check is made after the pp test (state 2.5), so an encoder that indexes during the test does not warn. If it still warns, the printed offsets are relative to power-up: index the encoder first.
