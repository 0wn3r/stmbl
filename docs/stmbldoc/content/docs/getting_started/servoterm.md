# Servoterm

Servoterm (servo terminal) provides an interface which allows editing of the drive HAL configuration. It also provides a rolling graphical representation of any chosen parameter in the HAL, which can be a great aid to tuning and motor setup.

Servoterm is now available as a C++ application. You can download it from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/STMBL/QtServoterm).  

## Installation

To install Servoterm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/STMBL/QtServoterm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd QtServoterm
   ```

3. Install the dependencies. Servoterm needs Qt5 with the Widgets, SerialPort and Network modules. On current Debian or Ubuntu, for example:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libqt5serialport5-dev
   ```
   (The QtServoterm README names `qt5-default`, which only exists on older releases such as Ubuntu 18.04.)

4. Build the application using qmake and make (a CMake build with the included `CMakeLists.txt` also works):
   ```sh
   qmake
   make
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```sh
   ./Servoterm
   ```

## Connecting to STMBL

To connect to the STMBL, you will need a USB C cable. 
{{% hint danger %}}
Be sure that the 24V PSU is floating or shares a ground reference with the PC.  
(Maybe even check the voltage between the connector and socket before inserting the plug.)
{{% /hint %}}  
You can then click the "connect" button and you should get something like the image below.

## Servoterm Interface

The toolbar, from left to right:

* **Port list** - a drop-down list to select the serial port of the drive.
* **Connect** / **Disconnect** (Connection) - open or close the serial connection.
* **Clear** - clears the console text. The scope is not cleared.
* **Disable** / **Enable** (Drive) - Disable sets `fault0.en = 0`. Enable sets `fault0.en = 0` and then `fault0.en = 1`, which also clears a soft fault. Neither reboots the STMBL. To reboot the drive, type `reset` (see [Servoterm Commands](#servoterm-commands)).
* **Jog** (Drive) - when ticked, the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard jog the motor. It sends the `jogl`, `jogr` and `jogx` commands, which only exist when the `jog` component is loaded, so Jog needs `link jog_cmd` in the config.
* **Show X/Y Scope** (View) - shows or hides the XY scope next to the graph.
* **Config** (Drive) - opens a window in which the drive config can be edited and saved (see [Saving a config](#saving-a-config)).

The **Esc** key is an emergency stop: it unticks Jog and sends `fault0.en = 0`.

Menus: **Record** is only in the Data menu. It saves the scope data to a CSV file.

{{% hint warning %}}
Esc, Disable and Enable set `fault0.en` to a constant value, and setting a pin to a value removes its link. With `link sserial`, this breaks the link `fault0.en = sserial0.enable`, so LinuxCNC can no longer enable or disable the drive. Do not use Enable, Disable or Esc on a drive that is run by LinuxCNC. If you did, type `reset` to reload the config.
{{% /hint %}}

Other than the buttons described above, the remainder of Servoterm (and the STMBL HAL) is controlled by a command-line interface at the bottom. Servoterm uses the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous commands, but there is no tab-completion. The basic syntax is:

* `<comp><n>`, for example `term0`, lists all pins of that component instance.
* `<comp><n>.<pin> = <value>` sets a pin to a value. If the pin was linked, the link is removed.
* `<comp><n>.<pin> = <comp><n>.<pin>` links the first pin to the second, so it follows its value.
* In the output, `<=` marks a linked pin: `term0.wave0 <= reslimit0.pos_out` means that wave0 follows `reslimit0.pos_out`.

Typed lines must be shorter than 64 characters. The drive reads each line into a 64-byte buffer, and a longer line is cut up and parsed wrongly.

More is described in the [HAL](/docs/introduction/#hal-hardware-abstraction-layer) section. The graphing display is controlled by the "term0" interface. Typing `term0` at the prompt will show output similar to:

```ini
term0.rt_prio = 16.000000
term0.frt_prio = 0.000000
term0.wave0 <= reslimit0.pos_out = 0.000000
term0.wave1 <= fb_switch0.plot_fb_pos = -0.000785
term0.wave2 <= vel0.vel = 0.000000
term0.wave3 <= vel1.vel = 0.000000
term0.wave4 = 0.000000
term0.wave5 = 0.000000
term0.wave6 = 0.000000
term0.wave7 = 0.000000
term0.offset0 = 0.000000
term0.offset1 = 0.000000
term0.offset2 = 0.000000
term0.offset3 = 0.000000
term0.offset4 = 0.000000
term0.offset5 = 0.000000
term0.offset6 = 0.000000
term0.offset7 = 0.000000
term0.gain0 = 20.000000
term0.gain1 = 20.000000
term0.gain2 = 1.000000
term0.gain3 = 1.000000
term0.gain4 = 10.000000
term0.gain5 = 10.000000
term0.gain6 = 10.000000
term0.gain7 = 10.000000
term0.send_step = 50.000000
term0.con = 1.000000
```  

The first two entries are internal information about the HAL component and can be ignored for now. The next 8 lines say what internal signal each of the wave plots is connected to. In this example, wave0 (black) is the position command `reslimit0.pos_out`, wave1 (red) is the position feedback `fb_switch0.plot_fb_pos`, and wave2 and wave3 are the command and feedback velocity. To see a test signal instead, type `term0.wave1 = sim0.vel`, which is a ramp (sawtooth) from the `sim0` component. Typing `sim0` shows the simulated signals. Each wave has an associated offset and gain parameter that can be used to adjust vertical scale and position. The links and gains shown above come from `link misc` in the config; without it, all gains default to 10. The `term0.send_step` parameter functions like the time-base of an oscilloscope.

## Servoterm Commands

The `help` command prints the live list of commands in the running firmware. Some commands only exist when their component is loaded. Commands to be used by the user:

* `bootloader`: enter bootloader
* `reset`: reset STMBL
* `about`: show system infos
* `help`: print this
* `link`: load config template
* `hal`: print HAL stats
* `hv_update`: update the F3 firmware
* `show_config`: show config templates
* `show`: show comps in flash
* `list`: show comp instances
* `hv FOOBAR XYZ`: send "FOOBAR XYZ" to the HV board
* `hv_verify`: read the F3 firmware back from its bootloader and compare it with the image embedded in the F4 firmware
* `enable` / `disable`: set `fault0.en` to 1 or 0 (this removes its link, see the warning above)
* `jogl` / `jogr` / `jogx`: jog left, jog right, stop jog (only with `link jog_cmd`)
* `linked`: show linked pins
* `uptime`: display uptime
* `tune`: play notes through the motor windings while the drive is enabled, e.g. `tune C4/4 E G C5/2`
* `tunex`: stop the tune
* `identify`: beep through the motor to find this drive (only while enabled)

The `tune`, `tunex` and `identify` commands only exist when the `melody` component is loaded (`link melody`).

Commands for internal use:

* `confcrc`: prints the RAM config as hex bytes, then its size and CRC (debug, long output)
* `flashloadconf`: load config from flash
* `flashsaveconf`: save config to flash (erases and rewrites a 16 KB flash sector, see [Saving a config](#saving-a-config))
* `loadconf`: parse config
* `showconf`: show config - pressing the `Config` button is better.
* `appendconf`: append string to config - also redundant with the config editor
* `deleteconf`: delete config
* `load`: load comp from flash
* `start`: start rt system
* `stop`: stop rt system
* `fault`: crashes the F4 on purpose to test the fault handler. It does not raise a drive fault code. The drive needs a power cycle or `reset` afterwards.
* `show_hal`: show the HAL structure
* `relink`: relink all HAL pins (a = b, b = c gives a = c, b = c)
* `debug_level`: set the HAL debug level, 0 = print all, 1 = print errors, 2 = no output
* `sleep`: wait for the given number of seconds
* `hv_pause <ms>`: stops sending to the F3 for 1 to 2000 ms, to test link loss. While the drive is enabled this raises fault 9. This is a test command, do not use it on a running machine.
* `hardboot`: **do not use.** It erases the first sector of the firmware to force the bootloader, so the drive must be flashed again.

## Saving a config

The **Save** button in the Config window sends `deleteconf`, then one `appendconf <line>` for each line of the config, and then `flashsaveconf`. Saving does not run the new config. Type `reset` to restart the drive with it.

`show_config` lists the templates that can be used with `link`, and `show_config <name>` prints one of them.

Because each line is sent as `appendconf <line>` and the drive reads lines of less than 64 characters, keep each config line under about 50 characters. A longer line is lost from the saved config. Split long comments into several lines.

{{% hint warning %}}
`flashsaveconf` erases and rewrites a 16 KB flash sector, which stalls the F4 briefly. Save only with the drive disabled. With LinuxCNC, save only with the machine off, because the stall trips the smart serial timeout.

## Servoterm Connection Problems

If you encounter connection issues, ensure that your serial setup is correct. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Serial Port**: Ensure that the correct serial port is selected in Servoterm.
2. **Ground Reference**: Make sure that the 24V PSU is floating or shares a ground reference with the PC.
3. **USB Cable**: Use a good quality USB C cable to connect the STMBL to your computer.


On Linux, add your user to the `dialout` group to be able to access the serial ports (on Arch Linux the group is `uucp`). If you have used the Arduino IDE before, this is probably already set. Log out and back in afterwards for the change to take effect:

```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

```

Linux udev rules. Save them as `/etc/udev/rules.d/49-stmbl.rules`:

```sh
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION!="add", GOTO="objdev_rules_end"
#stmbl
ATTR{idVendor}=="0483", ATTR{idProduct}=="5740", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
#ST USB bootloader
ATTR{idVendor}=="0483", ATTR{idProduct}=="df11", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
LABEL="objdev_rules_end"

```

Then reload the rules:

```sh
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

If you get AT commands showing up in servoterm some application is sending commands to the virtual serial port despite the `ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"` above. For example on xfce with debian 10, ModemManager may need to be stopped with `systemctl disable ModemManager.service` or removed with `sudo apt-get purge modemmanager`
