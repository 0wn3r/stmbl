/**
* ## Brief
* `hv` on the F3 (HV board) side: it turns the three phase voltages from `idq0` into TIM8 compare values that drive the power stage. It adds a dead time compensation, then the space vector (midpoint) common mode offset, keeps every pulse above a minimum on and off time, follows the PWM period that `ls0` sets to phase lock the board to the F4, and holds all low sides on while `io0` short-circuit brakes. It is loaded by `stm32f303/src/main.c` as `hv0` (rt_prio 6, after `idq0`) and is not configured by the user directly: its settings (`drop_k`, `drop_knee`, `arr`) come from the F4 through `ls0`. This page is the F3 component and is published as `hv_f3`. The F4-side counterpart, which configures the HV board and sends it the commands, is the `hv` component.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* 1. **Wiring on the F3** (fixed in main.c):
* - `hv0.u/v/w = idq0.u/v/w` (phase voltages centred on 0; `svm0` is no longer loaded, `hv` takes the offset itself), `hv0.udc = io0.udc_duty` (the fast link voltage), `hv0.arr = ls0.arr`, `hv0.drop_k = ls0.drop_k`, `hv0.drop_knee = ls0.drop_knee`, `hv0.sbrake = io0.sbrake_on`, and `ls0.duty_max = hv0.duty_max`.
* - For the dead time compensation: `hv0.d_cmd/q_cmd = ls0.d_cmd/q_cmd`, `hv0.si/co = idq0.si_out/co_out` (sin/cos of the voltage angle `ls0.pos_v`), `hv0.id_fb/iq_fb = dq0.d/q`, `hv0.cmd_mode = ls0.cmd_mode`, `hv0.phase_mode = ls0.phase_mode`.
* - `drop_band`, `drop_volt`, `drop_vlp`, `min_on` and `min_off` are not wired and not F4 config words: they keep their nrt_init defaults unless changed from the F3 terminal.
* - `enu`, `env`, `enw` are not wired and not read (TODO in the code): all three half bridges always switch.
*
* 2. **PWM period** (rt):
* - `arr` is clamped to 90..110 % of `PWM_RES` (4800) and written to `TIM8->ARR` every tick. `ls0` moves it by a few counts to lock the PWM to the F4's packets. nrt_init sets `arr` = `PWM_RES`.
* - TIM8 runs centre aligned at 144 MHz (`PWM_TIM_CLK`), so one PWM period is 2 * ARR ticks, 15 kHz at `PWM_RES`.
*
* 3. **Dead time compensation** (rt):
* - While a phase current keeps its sign the bridge loses the dead time's share of the PWM period times the link voltage. The size of the correction in volts (`udc` has a floor of 0.1 V):
* ```c
* dt_drop = drop_k * PWM_DEADTIME_TICKS / (2 * pwm_res) * udc;
* ```
* - `PWM_DEADTIME` is the BDTR.DTG code 196, which decodes to 288 ticks (2.0 us), so `drop_k` = 1 is 3 % of `udc`. `drop_k` = 0 (the default) turns the compensation off; a value below 1 accounts for the part of the dead time the switches' own delays eat. The result is clamped to 0..10 % of `udc`, so a mistyped `drop_k` distorts the waveform but cannot harm the bridge.
* - It is only applied in 120 deg 3 phase mode (`phase_mode` = 2). Otherwise it is 0.
* - Its sign per phase comes from a reference current, never the instantaneous measured one (keyed on that, the compensation drives the current it reads and runs away). The reference phase currents `iu`, `iv`, `iw` are built from a d/q reference with `si`/`co` (inverse Park and 120 deg inverse Clarke), every tick, also when the compensation is off. `si`/`co` belong to the voltage angle, the angle at which this tick's voltage is applied on average (see `ls0.pos_v`).
* - Current mode (`cmd_mode` != 0): the reference is the command, `d_cmd`/`q_cmd`.
* - Voltage mode (`cmd_mode` = 0, e.g. the spindle's V/f): there is no current command, so the reference is the measured `id_fb`/`iq_fb`, low pass filtered in the d/q frame with the time constant `drop_vlp` (default 3 ms, floor one period), so the sign follows the fundamental and not the ripple. The compensation is only applied here when `drop_volt` > 0 (default 0, off; only its sign is used).
* - `drop_knee` = 0 (default): latched sign. Per phase a Schmitt trigger flips to +1 above `drop_band` and to -1 below `-drop_band` and holds its value in between. `drop_band` defaults to 0.5 A and has a floor of 0.05 A. The sign starts at 0, and rt_start resets it to 0, so nothing is added until a phase has carried current once. The price is a sign that is stale while a zero crossing passes through the band, and an axis that draws less than `drop_band` never flips it at all.
* - `drop_knee` > 0 (A): curve instead of latch. Each phase gets `dt_drop * k(i)` with the sign of its reference current, where
* ```c
* k(i) = 1 - 1 / (1 + |i| / drop_knee)^2;
* ```
* - This follows the real loss, which fades out at low current (where the ripple carries the phase through zero inside the PWM period) and settles above a couple of amps. It cannot stick like the latch. `drop_knee` has a floor of 0.02 A.
*
* 4. **Space vector offset** (rt):
* - The compensation is added to `u`, `v`, `w` first, then the common mode is chosen on the compensated phases: `off = (min + max) / 2 - udc / 2`, subtracted from all three, so the midpoint of the highest and lowest phase sits at `udc / 2`. Because the offset sees the compensation, near full modulation the clamp below no longer cuts it.
* - Each phase is then converted to a compare value, `CLAMP(x, 0, udc) / udc * pwm_res`.
*
* 5. **Minimum on and off time** (rt):
* - `min_on` and `min_off` are in seconds, 3 us by default, converted to compare units at `PWM_TIM_CLK / 2` (one compare unit is 2 timer ticks in centre aligned mode, whatever ARR is), 216 units at 3 us. Both have a floor of the dead time plus 0.5 us (2.5 us): a shorter high side pulse never turns on through the driver interlock, and a shorter low side pulse leaves nothing for the current sample.
* - `duty_max = (pwm_res - min_on - min_off) / pwm_res` is output every tick (0.91 at the defaults). `ls0` scales `pwm_volt` by it, so `curpid0`'s voltage limit matches what this stage passes.
* - If the spread between the highest and lowest phase is larger than `pwm_res - min_on - min_off`, all three are scaled down around their centre (a float scale).
* - Then, judged on the values before any shift: if any phase is above 0 but below `min_on`, all three are moved up by what the lowest phase lacks (`min_on - min`); if the highest phase is above `pwm_res - min_off`, all three are moved down by its excess. The shift is only the deficit, so the neutral moves no more than needed; line to line voltages are unchanged.
* - Finally each phase between 0 and `min_on` is raised to `min_on`, and every phase is clamped to 0..`pwm_res - min_off`. A phase at exactly 0 (low side on for the whole period) is allowed.
*
* 6. **Short-circuit braking** (rt):
* - While `sbrake` > 0 (`io0.sbrake_on`) all three compares are forced to 0, so the low side switches of all phases are on and the back EMF drives current round the windings. `io0` switches the bridge on and off to chop that current; `hv` only provides the compare values.
*
* 7. **Output**:
* - The values go to `PWM_U/V/W` (TIM8 CCR3/CCR2/CCR1), inverted when the board defines `PWM_INVERT`.
*
* {{% hint warning %}}
* - `hv` has no enable or fault handling of its own. The bridge is switched on and off by `io0` (TIM8 MOE and the driver enable pin), so `hv` keeps writing compare values even while the bridge is off.
* - The voltage mode compensation (`drop_volt`) is new and off by default; it has not been tried on the spindle yet.
* - The compensation is added on top of the voltage `curpid0` was limited to, so near full modulation the spread can exceed `pwm_res - min_on - min_off` again and the spread scaling cuts it by a few percent.
* - `ls0.pwm_volt` is computed from the slow `io0.udc`, while this component divides by the fast `io0.udc_duty`, so during a fast link voltage change the two limits differ briefly.
