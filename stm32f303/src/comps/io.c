/**
* ## Brief
* `io` is the hardware I/O of the F3 (HV board). It reads the phase currents, phase voltages, DC link voltage and temperatures from the ADCs, calibrates the current offsets at boot, rebuilds a phase current the ADC could not sample, switches the power stage on and off, raises the HV fault codes (overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature, driver fault) and runs the short-circuit brake. It also drives the status LED, the brake output and the DAC reference of the overcurrent comparators. It is loaded by `stm32f303/src/main.c` as `io0` (rt_prio 1, so it runs right after `ls0` and `angle0`). The F3 rt runs once per PWM period, at `PWM_FREQ`, a build option (10, 15 or 20 kHz, default 15 kHz); tick counts below scale with it where noted.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* 1. **Wiring on the F3** (fixed in main.c):
* - Inputs: `io0.hv_en = ls0.en`, `io0.sbrake = ls0.sbrake`, `io0.dac = ls0.dac`, `io0.max_cur = ls0.oc_cur`, `io0.ignore_fault_pin = ls0.ignore_fault_pin`, `io0.led = ls0.fault`.
* - Outputs: `iu/iv/iw` go to `dq0`, `u/v/w` to `ls0.u_fb/v_fb/w_fb`, `ur/vr/wr` to `emf0`, `udc_duty` to `hv0.udc`, `udc` to `ls0.dc_volt`, `hv_temp`/`mot_temp` to `ls0`, `fault` to `ls0.fault_in` (sent to the F4), `sbrake_on` to `hv0.sbrake`.
* - `max_cur` on the F3 is the F4's `hv0.max_cur` before its `scale` (in practice `conf0.max_ac_cur`), so the trip and the short brake chop stay at the rated current when `fault0` derates the command limit. An older F4 that does not send it gives 0, and the trip is then `ABS_MAX_CURRENT` only.
*
* 2. **ADC readout** (rt):
* - ADC1/2 and ADC3/4 run as dual simultaneous pairs, triggered by TIM8 at the counter extreme where the low sides conduct (set up in main.c). Each pair converts three current samples (61.5 cycles each, about 3.1 us together) and one voltage. Each rt tick waits for both DMA transfers; if they have not finished after about 50 us the rt is stopped (`hal_stop`) and the watchdog resets the F3.
* - The phase currents are the mean of the three samples, converted with the shunt amplifier constants (3 mOhm shunt, gain 16) into amps (folded into one multiply and one subtraction), then the offset is subtracted and the sign inverted.
* - `ur`, `vr`, `wr` are the phase voltages to ground from one unfiltered ADC sample per PWM period, scaled by the resistor divider. They feed `emf0`.
* - `u`, `v`, `w` and `udc` are low pass filtered with `750 / PWM_FREQ` new value per tick (5 % at 15 kHz), a time constant of about 1.3 ms at any PWM frequency. `udc` is for display, `pwm_volt` and the trips.
* - `udc_duty` is the same link sample filtered with 50 % new value per tick (about 1.4 ticks), for `hv0`'s duty division, so link sag on acceleration and the rise on regen reach the duty within about 0.1 ms (at 15 kHz).
* - `iabs` is the largest of `|iu|`, `|iv|`, `|iw|` (after the reconstruction below).
*
* 3. **Phase current reconstruction** (rt, `recon` > 0, the default):
* - A phase's low side shunt only carries its current while its low side is on. From the TIM8 compare values `io` knows each phase's low side half pulse (`ARR - CCR`, in timer ticks): the half after the counter extreme comes from the compare loaded at this extreme (`io` runs before `hv0` rewrites it; read through `PWM_U/V/W`), the half before from last tick's.
* - A phase is flagged when the half after is shorter than the sample window (`ADC_CUR_WINDOW_TICKS`, the three conversions plus 0.5 us ring down, about 3.6 us) or the half before is shorter than the dead time (2.0 us). This happens near full duty: with `min_off` 3 us the low side is on for only part of the window, and the phase would read low, which the current loop answers by pushing harder (a torque reversal at speed).
* - The flagged phase is rebuilt from the other two, `iu = -(iv + iw)` and so on (no neutral, so the three sum to 0). If more than one is flagged, only the one with the shortest pulse is rebuilt. `recon_phase` shows which one this tick: 0 none, 1 u, 2 v, 3 w.
*
* 4. **Offset calibration** (rt, at start):
* - Ticks 0..99 are skipped. Ticks 100..199 average the current readings into the offsets. At tick 200, an offset above 5 A raises `HV_CURRENT_OFFSET_FAULT`. After that the offsets are output on `uo`, `vo`, `wo`, and normal operation starts. This takes about 13 ms at 15 kHz (20 ms at 10 kHz, 10 ms at 20 kHz). Before that, the bridge cannot be enabled.
* - The motor must not carry current while this runs (the F4 does not enable the bridge this early after boot).
*
* 5. **Faults** (rt):
* - `HV_TEMP_ERROR`: `hv_temp` > 110 degC (`ABS_MAX_TEMP`) for about 0.33 ms (`PWM_FREQ / 3000` ticks, 5 at 15 kHz).
* - `HV_VOLT_ERROR`: `udc` > 400 V (`ABS_MAX_VOLT`) for about 0.33 ms.
* - `HV_OVERCURRENT_FILTERED`: `iabs` > 0.95 * 35 A for about 0.33 ms, a filtered peak value.
* - `HV_OVERCURRENT_PEAK`: `iabs` > `oc_lim` in a single tick, or `iabs` > 35 A (`ABS_MAX_CURRENT`, the shunt measurement range, not a module rating). This is the main software trip, the one that follows the configured current:
* ```c
* oc_lim = max_cur > 0 ? CLAMP(oc_k * max_cur, oc_min, 35) : 35;
* ```
* - `oc_k` defaults to 1.3 and `oc_min` to 5 A; `oc_lim` shows the level in force.
* - `HV_FAULT_ERROR`: the driver's fault pin (PB7, active low) for about 0.33 ms while enabled, unless `ignore_fault_pin` is set.
* - `HV_OVERCURRENT_HW`: the bridge is enabled but TIM8's MOE bit has been cleared or a break flag (BIF/B2IF) is set. The flags catch a break that lands between the enable edge's MOE and driver enable writes and leaves MOE set again once the comparator releases. The comparators COMP2 (U, PA7), COMP4 (V, PB0) and COMP1 (W, PA1) compare the phase currents with the DAC reference (`dac`, raw 0..4095 on DAC1 channel 1, output buffer off) and trip the TIM8 break inputs in hardware (COMP4 on BRK, COMP1 and COMP2 on BRK2), all three through the break digital filter (0xC, fDTS/16 with N = 8, about 0.9 us). `cu`, `cv`, `cw` show the comparator outputs.
* - Second shutdown path: the break also raises `TIM8_BRK_IRQHandler` (main.c, NVIC priority 0; the rt on TIM8_UP runs at 1 and SysTick at 14, so it preempts the rt). It clears MOE, sets the driver enable pin PA15 high (the IPM's ITRIP) within about a microsecond instead of at the next rt tick (one to two PWM periods later, 67 to 133 us at 15 kHz), so the IPM turns its gate driver off on its own and holds it off for at least 40 us, and then switches the break interrupt (BIE) off so the still-set flag cannot re-enter. `io`'s nrt re-arms it, with the break flags cleared, whenever the bridge is not enabled and not braking; the fault itself is still reported by rt as above.
* - The 0.33 ms filters use `err_filter` with a limit of `PWM_FREQ / 3000` (5 at 15 kHz): +1 per tick with the error, -0.001 without (-0.01 for the fault pin), and trip at 99 % of the limit (4.95 at 15 kHz).
* - `fault` shows the current fault code (0 = none) every tick.
*
* 6. **Enable** (rt):
* - On the rising edge of `hv_en` stale break flags are cleared and the break interrupt is re-armed (a break while idle is not this enable's; a comparator still active keeps MOE off, which the `HV_OVERCURRENT_HW` check reports), then TIM8 MOE is set and the driver enable pin (PA15) is pulled low (enabled). `ls0` holds `hv_en` at 0 until the F4 has sent its whole configuration (after a boot, or after a link gap of 10 ms or more).
* - When a fault is set while enabled, MOE is cleared (all six outputs go to their idle state at once, as the comparators do in hardware) and the driver enable pin is set high, in the same tick, a fault pin trip included. The fault stays latched until `hv_en` goes to 0.
* - With `hv_en` = 0 and no braking, MOE is cleared, the driver enable pin is set high, and the fault is cleared (unless `sbrake` is still requested, see below). `HV_CURRENT_OFFSET_FAULT` is the exception: it is found once at boot and stays until reset, also over later trip codes (an overcurrent from the bad offset cannot hide it).
*
* 7. **Short-circuit braking** (rt, while `hv_en` = 0):
* - When `sbrake` > 0 (from the F4's flag, or from `ls0` on a link loss), the offset calibration is done, and no fault has been seen since the last rising edge of `hv_en`, `io` brakes: `sbrake_on` = 1, which makes `hv0` hold all compares at 0, so all three low sides are on and the back EMF drives current round the windings. The driver enable pin is pulled low.
* - The first 2 ticks keep MOE off, so the zero compares reach the timer first; stale break flags are cleared when braking starts.
* - After that the current is chopped per tick: `iabs` above the limit clears MOE for the next tick (the current then flows back into the DC link through the diodes), otherwise MOE is set.
* ```c
* lim = sbrake_cur > 0 ? sbrake_cur : (max_cur > 0 ? max_cur : 10);
* lim = MIN(lim, 0.8 * oc_lim);
* ```
* - Braking is refused after any fault since the last enable (a failed switch plus three low sides on would be another short), and before the first enable after power up.
* - While braking, the fault pin (unfiltered), a TIM8 break flag (`HV_OVERCURRENT_HW`) and all the checks of item 5 are watched. A fault stops the braking for good (until the next enable edge), turns MOE and the driver off, and stays reported in `fault` until `sbrake` goes to 0, so the F4 sees it and drops the request instead of retrying.
*
* 8. **Temperatures, LED and brake** (nrt):
* - The thermistor voltages are converted into degC with a beta model (85 kOhm at 25 degC, B = 4092), for `hv_temp` (3.9 kOhm pullup, ADC4 rank 2) and for `mot_temp` (10 kOhm pullup behind a 51k/10k divider, ADC4 rank 3). A resistance below 500 Ohm (above about 200 degC) reads as 0 degC. The logarithm is a single precision approximation (error well below 0.001 K). `mot_temp` is filtered with 1 % new value per nrt call.
* - The IPM's NTC shares the VFO pin, which the module pulls low while the driver enable pin (HV_EN) is high. So `hv_temp` is updated only while HV_EN is low and the pin is above 0.3 V: while enabled, more than `PWM_FREQ / 200` rt ticks (5 ms) after the enable edge, or while short-circuit braking, 5 ms (by `tick_ms()`) after braking started (the low sides heat then too). The first reading after power up or after a hold is taken as is, later ones are filtered with 1 % per nrt call.
* - Otherwise `hv_temp` is held and decays toward the coolest live reading since power up, with a time constant of 90 s, so a fan or derating keyed to it lets go after the bridge stops. `hv_temp_ok` is 0 before the first reading (`hv_temp` then reads 0), 1 while live and 2 while held.
* - The LED blinks `led` times (it is wired to `ls0.fault`), or 2 times while the HAL is not running normally.
* - If the brake circuit on PB2 reads high at start, `brk_present` is set to 1 and the pin becomes an output. `brk` > 0 then drives it low, otherwise high.
*
* {{% hint warning %}}
* - Both thermistors use the same NTC constants. This is specific to the HV board and to the motor sensor it was built for.
* - `brk`, `oc_k`, `oc_min`, `sbrake_cur` and `recon` are not wired in main.c and not carried by the F4 link, so they can only be changed from the F3 terminal.
