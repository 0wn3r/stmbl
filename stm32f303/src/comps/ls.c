/**
* ## Brief
* `ls` is the F3 (HV board) end of the serial link to the F4 (3 Mbaud UART, USART3 with DMA, CRC checked packets). It receives the current or voltage command, rotor angle, velocity, enable, mode and braking flags, plus one word of configuration per packet, and puts them on pins for the current loop, ramping the d/q command between packets. It answers with the measured d/q currents, output voltages, the fault code and one word of state per packet. It also locks the F3's PWM period to the F4's packet timing (trimming one period per packet), carries the F3 terminal (one byte each way per packet), holds the enable off until the whole configuration has arrived, disables the bridge when packets stop and can then ask `io0` for a short-circuit brake. It is loaded by `stm32f303/src/main.c` as `ls0` (rt_prio 0.6, the first in the chain). The F4 end of the link is the `hv` component.
*
* The F4 sends a packet every 200 us (5 kHz). The F3 rt runs once per PWM period at `PWM_FREQ`, a build option (`stm32f303/Makefile`, 10, 15 or 20 kHz, default 15 kHz), so there are `PWM_TICKS_PER_PACKET` = `PWM_FREQ / 5000` rt ticks per packet (3 at 15 kHz). The timings below are given in packets and hold at every PWM frequency; tick counts are for 15 kHz.
*
* ## Component Explanation
*
* 1. **Wiring on the F3** (fixed in main.c):
* - Commands out: `d_cmd`/`q_cmd` to `curpid0.id_cmd/iq_cmd` (and to `hv0` for the dead time compensation), `pos` to `dq0` and `emf0`, `pos_v` (see below) to `idq0`, `vel` to `curpid0`, `en` to `curpid0.en`, `io0.hv_en` and `emf0.en`, `cmd_mode` to `curpid0` and `hv0`, `phase_mode` to `dq0`, `idq0` and `hv0`, `sbrake` to `io0.sbrake`.
* - Configuration out: `r`, `l` (as `ld`), `lq`, `psi`, `cur_bw`, `cur_ff`, `cur_ind`, `max_cur` and `pwm_volt` to `curpid0`, `oc_cur` (as `max_cur`), `dac` and `ignore_fault_pin` to `io0`, `drop_k`, `drop_knee` and `arr` to `hv0`, `emf_run`/`emf_sel`/`emf_pp` to `emf0.run/sel/pp`, `fault` to `io0.led`.
* - Feedback in: `id_fb`/`iq_fb`/`y` from `dq0`, `ud_fb`/`uq_fb` from `curpid0`, `dc_volt` (`io0.udc`), `udc_duty` (`io0.udc_duty`), `hv_temp`, `hv_temp_ok`, `mot_temp`, `u_fb`/`v_fb`/`w_fb` and `fault_in` from `io0`, `emf_val` from `emf0.val`, `duty_max` from `hv0.duty_max`.
*
* 2. **Receiving** (rt):
* - The RX DMA writes each 32 byte `packet_to_hv_t` into the context. When all 32 bytes have arrived, the packet is accepted if `slave_addr` is 0, `len` matches and the CRC is right.
* - The header command is handled: `WRITE_CONF` stores the float into `f3_config_data_t` at `conf_addr`, `READ_CONF` sets the address of the next state word to send, `DO_RESET` resets the F3, `BOOTLOADER` sets a backup register flag and resets into the bootloader. Addresses past this image's config are ignored (the F4 may be newer than the F3 image; the layout is append only).
* - The process data goes to `phase_mode`, `cmd_mode`, `ignore_fault_pin`, `sbrake`, `sbrake_arm`, `pos` and `vel`, the d/q command becomes the new ramp target (item 4), and all configuration words go to their pins (`r`, `l`, `psi`, `cur_bw`, `cur_ff`, `cur_ind`, `max_y`, `max_cur`, `dac`, `drop_k`, `lq`, `emf_run`, `emf_sel`, `emf_pp`, `drop_knee`, `oc_cur`). `lq` falls back to `l` when the F4 sent 0. `oc_cur` is the F4's `max_cur` before `fault0.scale`; 0 from an older F4 makes `io0` trip at `ABS_MAX_CURRENT` only. A nonzero terminal byte is pushed into the F3's terminal RX buffer (read by `term0`).
* - `crc_ok` counts good packets, `crc_error` bad ones (this sets the communication fault to 3 for that tick).
* - Only one tick per packet sees a new one. In the others `pos` is extrapolated with `pos += vel * period` (not wrapped), until the timeout (`2 * PWM_TICKS_PER_PACKET - 1` ticks, 5 at 15 kHz).
* - After a whole packet has been taken (good or bad), the RX DMA is re-armed in the same tick instead of waiting for the idle line: at 10 and 20 kHz the tick can come before the idle flag, and the old packet would have been taken a second time.
*
* 3. **Enable only after a full configuration** (rt):
* - The F4 sends the 17 configuration words one per packet, so right after an F3 reset `r`, `l`, `max_cur`, `dac` etc. are still 0 for a while. `ls` keeps one bit per word written, and `conf_ok` becomes 1 once every word has been written at least once (the bits are cleared in rt_start, which also clears the ramp targets). Until then `en` stays 0 whatever the F4 asks; after that `en` follows the F4's enable flag.
* - A link gap of 10 ms (`PWM_FREQ / 100` ticks) clears the bits and `conf_ok` again: a restarted F4 sends its configuration from word 0, and the bridge stays off until the whole set has come round once more.
* - This assumes the F4 and F3 images come from the same build (same config layout): an older F4 that sends fewer words never gets `conf_ok`.
*
* 4. **Command ramp** (rt):
* - Stepped straight in, the d/q command would reach the current loop as a 5 kHz staircase. With `ramp` = 1 (the default, set in hw_init) each new packet's command is reached in `PWM_TICKS_PER_PACKET` equal steps, starting in the packet's own tick, so the command is a linear ramp that lags the F4 by about half a packet:
* ```c
* d_step = (d_tgt - d_cmd) / PWM_TICKS_PER_PACKET;  // on each packet, q alike
* d_cmd += d_step;                                  // in the first PWM_TICKS_PER_PACKET ticks after it
* ```
* - In any later tick (a late or missing packet), and always with `ramp` = 0, `d_cmd`/`q_cmd` are set to the last packet's command (which also cleans up the float sum).
*
* 5. **Voltage angle**:
* - `dq0` transforms the currents at the angle of the current sample. The voltage computed from them is preloaded and applied over the next PWM period, so on average it lands 1.5 periods later. `ls` therefore outputs a second angle, `pos_v = pos + vel * v_lead * period` (wrapped by `sincos_fast`), for `idq0` (and, through `idq0.si_out/co_out`, for `hv0`'s dead time reference).
* - `v_lead` is in PWM periods, 1.5 by default (set in hw_init); 0 gives one angle for both. With this, the F4's `hv0.adv` only has to cover the encoder to sample latency.
*
* 6. **Answering** (rt):
* - After each good packet, one `packet_from_hv_t` is sent by DMA: `fault_in`, `id_fb`, `iq_fb`, `ud_fb`, `uq_fb`, one byte from the terminal TX buffer, and one word of `f3_state_data_t` (in order `u_fb`, `v_fb`, `w_fb`, `hv_temp`, `mot_temp`, `core_temp`, `dc_volt`, `pwm_volt`, `y`, `emf_val`, two unused words (0), `pwm_freq` (the `PWM_FREQ` the image was built for, read by the F4 as `hv0.pwm_freq`), `link_to` (the `timeout` counter), `hv_temp_ok`), cycling through the 15 words one per packet.
* - A UART receive timeout (16 bit times of idle line) after a partial packet or noise resets the RX DMA so the next packet starts at byte 0, and `dma_pos` records how many bytes had arrived. The idle line that follows a whole packet is ignored, as the DMA was already re-armed (item 2) and the next packet may have started. `idle` counts all idle line events.
*
* 7. **PWM phase lock** (rt):
* - `dma_pos2` is the number of bytes of the current packet already received when the rt tick runs. On the first tick that finds a packet being received (more than `window` bytes from either end), `arr` is set to `PWM_RES - inc` if more than `dma_pos_cmd` bytes have arrived and to `PWM_RES + inc` if fewer. In every other tick it is `PWM_RES` (7200, 4800 or 3600 at 10, 15 or 20 kHz). So the period is trimmed at most once per packet (at 20 kHz several ticks fall inside one packet, and their votes would not cancel). `hv0` writes it to the PWM timer, so the F3's PWM and rt tick slide until they are in a fixed phase to the F4's packets.
* - rt_start sets `dma_pos_cmd` = 4, `inc` = `PWM_RES * 5 / 4800` (5 at 15 kHz, about 0.1 %), `window` = 1.
*
* 8. **Timeout and braking on link loss** (rt):
* - After two missed packets (0.4 ms, more than 5 rt ticks at 15 kHz without a good packet), `en` and `vel` are set to 0, `timeout` is counted up every tick and the communication fault is 1. The bridge is thus switched off by `io0` and `curpid0`. The internal tick counter saturates, so a long loss cannot wrap it and re-enable the bridge.
* - On the first timeout tick `ls` decides whether to brake: only if the F4's last packet had `sbrake_arm` set and the motor was driven (`en`) or already braking (`sbrake`). If so, `sbrake` goes to 1 once four packets are missed (0.8 ms, so one or two packets lost to noise only take the gates off until the next one) and is held for `sbrake_time` (1 s, set in rt_start) from then, and `io0` short-circuit brakes the motor on its own; otherwise `sbrake` is 0.
* - While packets arrive, `sbrake` simply follows the F4's flag (the F4 only sets it while `en` is 0).
*
* 9. **Faults and voltage limit** (rt):
* - `fault` = MAX(communication fault, `fault_in`). It only drives the LED blink count (`io0.led`). The F4 gets `fault_in` (the `io0` fault code) and detects CRC errors and timeouts on its own side.
* - `pwm_volt`, the largest voltage vector `curpid0` may output, depends on `phase_mode`: `udc_duty / sqrt(3) * duty` for 120 deg 3 phase, `udc_duty / sqrt(2) * duty` for 90 deg 3 phase, `udc_duty * duty` for 90 deg 4 phase and the 180 deg modes, else 0. `udc_duty` is the fast DC link value `hv0` divides by, so the ceiling follows link sag and regen. `duty` is `duty_max` from `hv0` (0.91 with the default 3 us minimum on and off times at 15 kHz), or 0.95 when `duty_max` is 0 (not wired).
*
* {{% hint warning %}}
* - The communication fault codes 1 (timeout) and 3 (CRC) are not `fault_t` codes (they would read as `CMD_ERROR` and `COM_FB_ERROR`). They are only used for the LED blink count and never reach the F4.
* - `max_y` is received but not used by anything on the F3, and `core_temp` is not wired, so it is always sent as 0.
* - A config word still takes effect as soon as it arrives, one per packet; `conf_ok` only guards the first enable after a reset or a 10 ms link gap, not later changes while enabled.
* - `sbrake_time` is reset to 1 s by rt_start and is not an F4 config word, so the F4's own braking time does not apply to a link loss.
